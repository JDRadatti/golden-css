# LiftKit CSS

LiftKit CSS is the vanilla CSS version of Chainlift's LiftKit design system. It's a lightweight framework of utility classes that use golden ratio scaling to provide a uniquely "oddly-satisfying" look. 

This fork aims to provide additional functionality and components, for a more complete frontend framework kit.
